> A Stan-powered time-series model that **never breaks the 0-1 bounds** while delivering more accurate forecasts than Prophet for rates and probabilities.

*Your conversion rates deserve better than to be treated like stock prices!*

## 🚀 Prophet, but Better for Bounded Data

Prophet is great, but it wasn't built for churn rates, conversion percentages, or hotel occupancy. **Murphet was.** 

When forecasting rates, the last thing you want is predictions that break the logical 0-1 bounds. But that's exactly what happens with vanilla Prophet when forecasting:
- Conversion rates
- Churn probabilities
- Occupancy percentages
- Click-through rates
- Any metric bounded between 0 and 1

Murphet fixes this with a **Beta likelihood** that respects these natural boundaries while providing more accurate forecasts. It's Prophet's smarter cousin - specifically designed for the data you're actually working with.

## 1 · Why Choose Murphet?

| Prophet's Limitation | Murphet's Solution | Your Benefit |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| ❌ Predictions can go <0 or >1 | ✅ **Beta head** keeps everything in (0,1) | Never explain impossible forecasts to stakeholders again |
| ❌ One-size-fits-all variance model | ✅ **Heteroscedastic precision** adapts to data level | Better uncertainty intervals, especially near boundaries |
| ❌ Hard changepoints create artificial kinks | ✅ **Smooth logistic transitions** between trends | More realistic forecasts with less overfitting |
| ❌ Seasonality coefficients often explode | ✅ **Regularized Fourier terms** with sensible priors | Stable seasonal patterns even with limited data |
| ❌ Ignores autocorrelation in residuals | ✅ **Latent AR(1) structure** captures persistent patterns | Dramatically improved forecast accuracy |
| ❌ Same error structure for all predictions | ✅ **Data-adaptive variance** via smart link functions | Properly calibrated prediction intervals |

```python
import pandas as pd, numpy as np
from murphet import fit_churn_model

df = pd.read_csv("churn_data.csv")        # cols: ds, y  (0<y<1)
df["ds"] = pd.to_datetime(df["ds"])
df["t"]  = np.arange(len(df))             # integer index

mod = fit_churn_model(
        t              = df["t"],
        y              = df["y"],
        periods        = 12, num_harmonics = 3,    # yearly seasonality
        n_changepoints = 4,
        likelihood     = "beta",                   # default & safest
        inference      = "nuts",                   # full posterior
      )

future_t = np.arange(len(df), len(df)+6)

## 4 · Model Architecture

<img src="docs/figs/murphet_diagram.svg" alt="Murphet Model Architecture" width="50%">

Murphet combines the best of structural time series modeling with modern Bayesian methods:

| Component | Equation | What It Gives You |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Trend | *μ<sub>det</sub>(t) = k·t + m + ∑ δ<sub>j</sub> σ(γ (t − s<sub>j</sub>))* | Smooth transitions between trend regimes |
| Seasonality | Fourier blocks on raw *t* (`fmod`) | Flexible multi-periodic patterns |
| Link / saturation | *μ* → `logit⁻¹` → *p* | Automatic boundary adherence |
| Likelihoods | **Beta(p·φᵢ,(1-p)·φᵢ)**   or   **Student-t<sub>ν</sub>(μ,σᵢ)** | Properly scaled uncertainty |
| Latent error | *y\* = μ<sub>det</sub> + ρ·lag* | Capture autocorrelated patterns |

### Advanced Features

| Feature | Implementation                                                                                                            | Business Impact                   |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **AR(1)** latent error | `real<lower=-1,upper=1> rho; real mu0;` + update in `partial_sum_*`                                                       | Catch slow-moving market trends   |
| **Heteroscedastic precision** | `phi_i = exp(log_phi0 - beta_phi*abs(mu_det));` (Beta) / `sigma_i = exp(log_sigma0 + beta_sigma*abs(mu_det));` (Gaussian) | More accurate risk assessment     |
| **Heavy-tail option** | `student_t_lpdf(y \ ν, μ, σᵢ)` with `ν ~ Exp(1/30)`                                                                       | Robustness to outliers and shocks |

### Residual Diagnostics
![Residual diagnostics](docs/figs/retail_diag.png)

Murphet's AR(1) and heteroscedastic components virtually eliminate autocorrelation structures that Prophet leaves behind.

## 6 · Choosing the Right Model Head

| Likelihood | Best For | Technical Details | Examples |
|------------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Beta (default)** | True proportions, rates, percentages | Logit⁻¹ link + `Beta(p·φᵢ,(1-p)·φᵢ)` likelihood | Conversion rates, CTR, churn % |
| **Gaussian / Student-t** | Approximate ratios or unbounded metrics | Identity link + `Normal/Student-t(μ,σᵢ)` | Price ratios, normalized KPIs |

Simply set `likelihood="gaussian"` to switch; all other API calls remain identical.
